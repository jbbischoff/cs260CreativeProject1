        <p class="document-item letter-intro">Dear Parents and Students,</p>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          Welcome to sixth grade English! I am so excited to get to know each
          and every one of your students this year. This year in my English
          classes, heavy emphasis will be placed on writing. I plan to make our
          assignments fun and dynamic enough so that all of the hard work will
          be very rewarding.
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Contact</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          Don’t hesitate to get in touch with me. I will try to be as accessible
          as possible. Email is usually a fantastic way to contact me. I check
          my email multiple times every day and usually respond very quickly.
          You can also call the extension above which will direct you to my
          voicemail during instruction time and I will return your call at a
          later time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Class Rules</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          In my classroom we will follow all Renaissance Academy school rules.
          These rules are simple and effective. I am dedicated to their
          enforcement in order to facilitate the best possible learning
          environment for every student. These rules are meant to create and
          foster respect, cooperation, and a safe learning environment for all
          students. The rules and consequences are as follows:
        </p>

        <h3 class="document-item document-section-sub-headding">Rules</h3>
        <ul class="document-item document-list document-unorderd-list">
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            We are <strong>Successful</strong>: We come prepared, learn from our
            mistakes, and always try our best.

          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            We are <strong>Respectful</strong>: To others, teacher, self, and property.

            We are <strong>Responsible</strong>: We arrive on-time and are organized.

          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            We are <strong>Honest</strong>: We tell the truth and do our own
            work (unless it’s group work).
          </p></li>
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            We are <strong>Kind</strong>: We think before we speak, and are positive.

            We are <strong>Safe</strong>: We keep our hands to ourselves and
            only use objects for their intended purpose.
          </p></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="document-item document-section-sub-headding">Consequences</h3>
        <ol class="document-item document-list document-ordered-list">
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            Warning.
          </p></li>
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            In-classroom time-out and discussion with the teacher about their behavior.
          </p></li>
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            The student will be given a “Behavior Reflection Form” to fill out
            in class. This form may be sent home for a parent signature and
            is to be returned the following day.
          </p></li>
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            If poor behavior continues, the student will be sent home with an
            after-school detention form. This form is to be signed and returned
            the following day. Parents may also be notified with a phone call
            or email after school. Detention is held after school for 30 minutes.
          </p></li>
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            Any extreme bad behavior will result in the student being sent down
            to the office. Parents will be notified.
          </p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          I dislike assigning detention. I don’t want to do it. But I am just as
          obligated to follow the class rules as my students are. I also have a
          zero-tolerance policy for any bullying behavior. Cell phones are never
          allowed in class.
        </p>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          I believe in clean slates, so every day we begin again from the top,
          regardless of consequences handed out the previous day. That being
          said, if a student earns multiple in-classroom time-outs within the
          same week, a “Behavior Reflection” will be filled out and the student
          may earn a detention.
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Food and Drink Policy</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          Students are welcome to have a water bottle on their desk. Water bottle
          flipping will not be tolerated. In accordance with Renaissance Academy
          policy, snacks are not allowed during class. If students are hungry,
          they can eat at lunchtime or quickly eat a snack between classes.
        </p>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          Because we have students with severe nut allergies, my classroom is a
          nut-free zone. Students should leave any nutty snacks in their lockers
          as these will not be allowed in class.
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Absences</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          It is the student’s responsibility to catch up on any material missed
          during an absence. This can be done by checking the my blog for
          assignments, sending me an email, or speaking with me after class. If
          advance notice is given, the student will be given a packet with work
          to complete. I prefer students to get their work done ahead of time so
          they won’t be lost when they return.
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Sickness and Medication</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          If your child becomes sick during the day they will be allowed to call
          home from the phone in the office. They will still need to be checked
          out from the office and parents can pick them up there and follow
          proper check-out procedure. If your child has special medication needs
          during school hours, the medicine needs to be taken to the office and
          dispensed from there. This excludes things such as cough drops, etc.
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Grading</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          At the heart of this policy is the belief that a grade should be an
          accurate measurement of what the student knows more than anything
          else as we move throughout the school year. This has far-reaching
          ramifications.
        </p>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          If the grade should represent what a student knows, then padding a
          grade with extra credit assignments is not appropriate because the
          amount, type, and worth of these assignments may vary from year to
          year, teacher to teacher. Not only that, extra credit shows how hard
          a student is willing to work (usually last minute) to make up for
          earlier failings. Again, this does not necessarily represent what a
          child knows. It just shows how much he or she can work—which is
          commendable, but it doesn’t help teachers gauge where the student is
          at in terms of understanding required material. Extra credit work
          only serves to pad a poor grade and does not reflect what a student
          actually knows. Thus, extra credit will not be given and attendance
          and citizenship are also not counted in the main grade.
        </p>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          There are two types of assessments/assignments. Formative and Summative:
        </p>
        <ul class="document-item document-list document-unorderd-list">
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            Formative assessments are limited to a maximum of 25% of a child’s
            grade. These assignments are things such as daily work, group work,
            and homework. They help me measure how a student is progressing and
            allow me to tell how much time I need to dedicate to teaching a
            principle.
          </p></li>
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            Summative assessments are things like quizzes, tests, and major
            writing assignments. They are worth a minimum of 75% of a student’s
            grade. They measure actual attainment of skills and knowledge. If
            your child is absent on assessment days or does not turn in major
            writing assignment on time, their grade may suffer greatly.
          </p></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          The academic proficiency scale is as follows:
        </p>
        <ol class="document-list-item document-list document-ordered-list grade-scale-list">
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            A (90-100%) Advanced / Exceeds Standards
          </p></li>
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            B (80-89%) Proficient / Meets Standards
          </p></li>
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            C (70-79%) Nearing Proficiency / Approaching Standards
          </p></li>
          <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
            D (<69%) Novice / Below Standards
          </p></li>
        </ol>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          Late work will be accepted, but points will be docked based on how
          late the work is. Until the late work is submitted, a zero will
          appear in the gradebook. This is a place holder. If I could enter
          an ‘I’ for incomplete, I would. I want every student to complete
          their assignments so that they can demonstrate mastery of the
          content before they are tested. That said, if I receive a request
          for 20 missing assignments right before the end of term, I will
          make an exception to this policy and NOT accept that work. Not
          doing homework during an entire term and then submitting it all at
          the end does not help me accurately measure a student’s progress
          through the year. Late work, if it is necessary, should be
          submitted within a month of the due date. One week before the
          term end, late work of any kind will no longer be accepted.
        </p>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          I allow my students to retake tests or quizzes if they scored a C
          or lower. There are two ways to do this: students can choose to
          either fix their incorrect answers for partial points, or they can
          retake the test in its entirety for full points. This must be
          completed in my classroom, outside of regular class time. Students
          may come in before school, during lunch, during recess, or after
          school, and I will make the test available to them. Tests remain
          “open” for three weeks, during which time students may correct
          their answers or retake the test. Three weeks after the test was
          originally administered, the test closes and corrections are no
          longer possible.
        </p>

        <p class="document-item document-content">
          If you have any questions regarding these policies, please email me at
          sambischoff@notarealemail.com and I will do my best to answer promptly.
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Homework</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          I will do my best to assign as little homework as possible. That said,
          when I do assign homework, I expect it to be completed. I will avoid
          scheduling homework over weekends and holidays. The exception to this
          rule is personal reading and the occasional large assignment. In these
          cases, I will give ample time to complete the assignment on week nights
          if the student so chooses. This is so that with hard work and planning,
          the assignment can be completed in school or on weeknights. With grammar
          and spelling worksheets, homework will only be assigned if I truly
          believe the students need extra practice in order to grasp a principle.
        </p>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          Any missing assignments must be completed. Missing work is not
          acceptable. In my classroom I make information about missing
          assignments readily available so that my students are aware of what
          they are missing. I may send out an email during the term informing
          parents about missing work. My intent with these emails is purely
          informative. I want you to be involved with your child’s education and
          to know if they are completing their work or falling behind, but I
          also believe that keeping on top of assignments is primarily the
          responsibility of the student.
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Assessments</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          Assessments will be administered periodically. Students may retake
          tests for full points. Half points will be given for every “answer
          correction.” This gives the student the opportunity to turn tests into
          learning experiences as well as give every student the opportunity to
          score better on the exam. For example, correcting answers instead of
          retaking the test can turn a grade of 60/100 (D-) into 80/100 (B-).
          It’s worth the extra work!
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Book Reports</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          Book reports will be due about every six weeks. Each student’s
          independent reading will work in tandem with this assignment. Students
          must complete 280 minutes of reading every two weeks – about 20
          minutes a day. Independent reading can be tracked with a reading log
          bookmark. At the end of every two weeks this bookmark will be turned
          in and given a grade based on submission rather than completion. This
          will allow me to better track student reading habits. I believe that
          solo reading at home is the single biggest indicator for success.
          Consistent reading will improve all aspects of a student’s education.
          This is very important.
        </p>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          I am giving students the option to select their own texts. I also have
          a list of recommended titles if they are out of ideas. So if a student
          hates what they read it’s their own fault! The report shouldn’t be a
          huge project. It can take many different shapes, so make it fun! I am
          mostly interested in having the students read on a regular basis. I
          will include a list of ideas for the book report assignment on the
          website under “Resources”.
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Major Writing Assignments</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          Essays will be a large part of this class. This is usually a paper
          based on a theme or a text we have read together. We will take time
          in class to work on structure, flow, and mechanics to prepare students
          to write essays of increasing length. These will make up a significant
          part of a student’s grade because this is how I assess a student’s
          writing ability. The entire rough draft should be completed in class.
          The only thing that may be done at home is typing and printing or
          submitting the final draft. If students are complaining about how much
          work they have to do at home on the papers, it is because they are not
          using class time wisely.
        </p>

        <h2 class="document-item document-section-headding">Final Research Paper</h2>
        <p class="document-item document-content">
          State standards require students to write at least one research-based
          paper this year. All of my teaching will be geared toward helping
          students write a cohesive, well-worded 3 page paper. This paper will
          be assigned near the end of the year. It will be based off of a
          self-generated question. By the time the final paper rolls around, the
          students will be little experts in writing papers. There is no need to
          feel daunted by this assignment.
        </p>

          Thanks for reading! I can’t wait to get started.
