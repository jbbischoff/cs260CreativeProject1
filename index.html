            As Term 2 comes to a close, I would like  to review some important
            classroom policies.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            Tests and Quizzes close after 3 weeks. Missed tests must be taken
            within that time. Test retakes or test corrections must also be
            completed within that 3 week window. Once a test is closed, the
            grades entered are final. Exceptions can be made for extended
            absences that have been discussed with me beforehand.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            Formative assignments may be turned in late with no point penalty up
            until my late work deadline for each term (usually one week before
            the term ends).
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            Summative assignments may be turned in late, but will have a point
            penalty that increases with each late day until the maximum grade
            for turning it in becomes an 80%. For this reason, it is imperative
            that summative assignments are turned in on time. (These assignments
            include final papers and book reports.)
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            The names of students missing tests is posted in my classroom. I
            also keep a list of missing assignments for each student. Both these
            lists are updated at least once weekly. I try to make this
            information as available as possible so that students can keep on
            top of their tests and assignments.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            I am always happy to work with and assist students who approach me
            with questions or concerns. I am available for 20 minutes before
            school, during lunch or recess, or for 30 minutes after school (with
            occasional exceptions for meetings).

        <h1 class="page-title">Test Correction/Retake Policy Change</h1>
        <div class="document-container">
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            This new reading curriculum has been really fun to dive into with my
            students, but new systems always come with a bug or two. It has come
            to my attention that when students review their online tests, it not
            only tells them the wrong answer, but tells them which answer was
            correct. This makes it impossible for students to correct their
            wrong answers for partial points or to retake tests.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            It is important to me that students are given opportunities to learn
            from their mistakes and have second chances to demonstrate their
            knowledge. Test retakes and corrections are a great learning
            opportunity for the students who take advantage of them and also
            prepares students for future tests and assessments. For these
            reasons, I have made a few adjustments to my test correction and
            retake policy, as well as to the way we take tests in class.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            We will no longer be taking tests on the myngconnect system, though
            we may still use computers at times.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            Tests will remain open for three weeks, during which time students
            may make answer corrections or retake the test. After the three
            weeks, the test closes and changes can no longer be made to the grade.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            Test retakes and corrections must be done in my classroom either
            before school, during lunch or recess, or after school.

        <h1 class="page-title">One Month Down….</h1>
        <div class="document-container">
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            The first month of Middle School can always be challenging. Students
            are trying to get used to their schedules, and having so many
            teachers. Organization is a constant struggle, and students are
            learning how to take accountability for their own success.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            It can be a rough transition period, and I do my best as a teacher
            to help students learn successful habits.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            In my class all students should have a three ring binder and a folder
            (in addition to lined paper and pencils). That means that every
            student should have at least two if not four “pockets” to put work.
            In class, to help struggling students with their organization, I
            have encouraged them to designate one of their pockets for the
            following purposes:
          </p>
          <ul class="document-item document-list document-unorderd-list">
            <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
              Work that is not done yet and needs to be finished
            </p></li>
            <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
              Work that is done and needs to be turned in
            </p></li>
            <li class="document-list-item-container"><p class="document-list-item document-content">
              Work that has been graded and passed back
            </p></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            On my white board I keep an accurate assignment list, outlining that
            will be due at the end of a given week. Students are encouraged to
            write these lists into their planners so that they can keep track of
            what work is expected of them that week.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            I keep a list of missing work for each student in a packet in my
            classroom as well. This is updated weekly. Students know that they
            can check the packet to see what assignments or tests they are missing.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            I also allow test makeups if a student was absent or received a low
            score. Tests are only open for two weeks (unless a student has been
            absent for an extended time). This means that all test makeups must
            be completed within that time frame. Students can choose to either
            retake the test for full points or fix their incorrect answers for
            partial points.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
            It is important to me that my students learn accountability and gain
            the skills that will make them successful lifelong learners.
          </p>
          <p class="document-item document-content">
